so basically there are going to be 3 dimensions coming of each current dimensions(over-world, nether and end)
and many side dimensions on those 3 per current dimensions.
so the current dimensions we know were making are:
the strand dimension(coming off the over world),
the junk yard dimension(coming of the end)
and the mushroom dimension(coming off the nether).
